      "September 2019 - Whether we are aware of it or not, love is all around us. If only we could realize it. There are many people who love us. Think of your family, friends, and the partners who cherish us. But the biggest question to ask ourselves is what love is.",
      "Different people interpret it in a variety of ways. Some take it to be the emotional feeling they share with their partners (for those who are in a relationship or marriage). For others, it is that care that they receive from their parents, siblings, and other people who are close to them. But all of this brings us to one conclusion: love is everywhere, even if some people are oblivious of it.",
      "However, the psychology of love looks at things in a deeper way. It can be said that different types of love do exist and all affect people in many ways. Do you know that love can change the way a person behaves? Yes, it can. This is one of the factors that we will look at in detail here in a bit.",
      "Types of Love to Know",
      "Before we delve into details of how love changes people, let us look at the types of love that everyone should know.",
      "Agape love - This is love with no conditions or boundaries. But who else can give such selfless love than one who is connected to you spiritually? That is why the Greeks thought of this as a love that is not given by people to people, but by a supernatural being to people.",
      "Erotic love - This has a strong connection to the good of fertility. It is love that is related to procreation in human beings. Greeks believed that one could not control this love. Thus, when two people are in erotic love, they end up in marriage and have children as a result.",
      "Affectionate love - This should not and never be confused with erotic love. Affectionate love, according to those who have dated online on websites like Happymatches, is love that you give to people who cannot be considered as your life partner. It is often short-term with some people today doing it on a contractual basis. It typically has mutual benefits.",
      "Self-love - Everyone loves themselves. This is driven by the instinct that people will always treat themselves in a special way before anyone else can do so. It is pretty obvious that people love themselves.",
      "There are many other types of love that exist and each one affects people in a different way. The part of the body that is mostly affected by this is the brain, so it is no wonder that love is more psychological. The brain triggers many other things in the body through chemical reactions to alter behavior, feelings, and even what people say.",
      "Psychological Effects of Love",
      "Love changes how people view others and other things. Let's use an example of erotic love. When a person meets the perfect partner and falls in love, they will tend to push all of their other friends to the side. If there were other close people who also wanted to have a relationship with you, a distance will be created without even thinking about it. Even if some feelings were developing towards them, this will quickly fade away. It is even possible for love to change from one type to another during such a transition.",
      "Some people get so influenced by those that they love or those who love them that they copy their behavior. This is common in married couples or those who are engaged in a long-term relationship. According to experts, love has a strong effect on how people think and behave, and this is evident in many social types of research that have been conducted in the past."

      "Before you start showing love, mostly for the sake of a relationship, you need to understand what type of love it is between erotic love and affectionate love, or in normal words, serious love and casual love. It is not fair to approach the other person with a pretense of showing them erotic love only to dump them later because all that you needed was affectionate love for a short time.",

      "   1. Depression",
      "If your migraines occur once in a while, then you have double the risk of depression than someone who doesn't get them at all. Similarly, if you experience chronic migraines which occur several times a month, your risk doubles again. There is such a strong link between depression and migraines because often, people with migraines can become depressed because of the terrible pain.",
      "On the other hand, depression can also come first, soon to be followed by painful migraines. People with migraines are three times more likely to have depression and patients with depression are also three times more likely to have a migraine. It causes patients to feel sad, hopeless, fatigued, and disinterested in things they used to enjoy.",
      "   2. Anxiety",
      "Of those suffering from migraines, around 50%-60% will suffer from anxiety. In fact, people with chronic migraines are more likely to have anxiety than they are depression. Similar to depression, the anxiety or the migraines can come first. During a migraine attack, anxiety is often based on worry directly related to the attack, such as wondering how long it will last and when the medication will start to work.",
      "Even when the patient isn't experiencing a migraine, they might become anxious about when their next one will be. Interestingly, patients that have anxiety in life are more likely to develop migraines, and vice versa. If the patient suffers from depression and anxiety, they may need to take separate medication to treat each condition individually.",
      "   3. Increased Fatigue",
      "Many people who experience chronic migraines also feel fatigued. This level of fatigue can last a long time and cannot always be cured with a good night's sleep. Fatigue can then have a knock-on effect on your mental health, as you start to feel sluggish and less engaged. This can cause depression or add to the symptoms of pre-existing depression. What's more, blurred vision and poor co-ordination can also be a side-effect of fatigue. If a patient experiences fatigue, they are more likely to take time off work until they feel well enough to return. Wellness retreats or specialist aesthetic clinic Manchester offers can leave them feeling more rejuvenated and less tired.",
      "   4. Changes in Your Mood",
      "Migraines often develop in distinct stages for many people, the first of which is a change in your mood. In the same way that anxiety can cause patients to worry about an attack, patients can experience a change in their mood before it happens.",
      "Changes in energy levels, behaviour and appetite can occur several hours or even days before having a migraine attack. Then, the actual headache stage occurs, where patients will experience the pulsating or throbbing pain on one side of the head. After, is the resolution stage. Again, at this time, patients are more likely to experience changes in their mood which can last a few days.",
      "   5. Poor Memory",
      "An acute confusional migraine (ACM) is a rare type of migraine that primarily affects teenagers and children. Many are still left undiagnosed but affects around 10% of children and teenagers. When experiencing an acute confusional migraine attack, one of the main symptoms is memory loss. Other symptoms include disorientation, blurred vision and speech impairment. Though this memory loss is only temporary, there is evidence to suggest chronic migraines can impact memory permanently. However, this is still very much a topic undergoing research."

Living a healthy lifestyle and eating properly is great, and filling in the gaps with the effective supplements below is even better. There is a lot of controversy surrounding the effectiveness of supplements on long term function, and although research is mixed, the popular belief is that many of these supplements can help to boost memory, creativity, motivation and general brain functioning. Below we have a list of a few of the supplements that you should either try or avoid!",
      "Try - Fish Oils",
      "The Omega-3 Fatty Acids found in fish oils are believed to play a vital role in maintaining the function and structure of the brain, and it is found within brain cells. It also has anti-inflammatory effects that can protect against damage and ageing. It isn't necessarily associated with improved brain function, yet, for people with mental health issues such as depression, it is known to improve mood. Find your Omega-3 in fish and other seafood, particularly cold-water fatty fish such as tuna, salmon and mackerel. Taking EPA fish oil is especially important if you don't eat much fish, or none at all. Regardless of your diet, taking fish oils can be very useful.",
      "Avoid - Prevagen",
      "Supplements on the market can often make rather vague claims about the effects they can have which can really mislead consumers. Also, often, there isn’t any proof of the positive effects that the products claim to have. Prevagen is a supplement that is said to contain an ingredient that is derived from jellyfish and is said to support cognitive function. However, there is no proof of there being any well-designed studies to test the effectiveness of the supplement. This is an example of the money-fuelled side of pharmaceuticals, so perhaps give this one a miss.",
      "Try - Ginkgo Biloba",
      "Researchers believe that ginkgo can improve cognitive function as it encourages a good circulation of blood in the brain, and protects it from damage. It has been suggested that it can reduce symptoms of psychiatric disorders, anxiety and depression, as well as dementia and healthy brain function in general. It is also thought to contain powerful antioxidants. However, it is thought that the benefits of ginkgo may only really apply to older people, so consider this before purchasing.",
      "Avoid - Choline",
      "Choline is an essential nutrient found in meat, eggs and dairy, yet when consumed in excess, it can raise levels of bacteria which can increase the likelihood of platelets joining together to create clots. This can be really dangerous, as it prevents blood flow and can lead to fatal health issues such as strokes or heart attacks. Although consuming choline in your normal diet is healthy, it doesn’t seem to be advisable to take any in the form of supplements.",
      "Try - Caffeine",
      "Coffee is extremely popular across the globe, mainly as a morning wake-me-up. But is it good for your brain? It has been heavily criticised in the past, but it actually can be very healthy and beneficial when consumed in moderation. Caffeine found in coffee stimulates the central nervous system, as it prevents adenosine from slowing you down and makes you feel alert. In terms of actual brain function, it has been suggested that caffeine can improve mood, general mental function, vigilance and also memory. Researchers are still debating the effects of caffeine on long term-memory, yet it has found that caffeine may enhance short-term memory. Other studies, however, have shown no effects on memory at all. Aside from the perceived benefits on memory, the other benefits it can have for the brain make it certainly worth trying."

      "Over 40 million people have been diagnosed with anxiety in the USA alone. Exercise is a natural remedy to lower anxiety levels, as a result of happiness-boosting chemicals being released in the brain. Although these effects may only be temporary, spending time outdoors and taking on some gentle exercise is an ideal calming mechanism to give you some perspective on your issues. It may also gradually reduce your reliance on medication for anxiety and depression.",
      "Makes you more alert",
      "Exercise feeds the brain important nutrients to increase cognitive functioning, meaning you're far more likely to be productive in the workplace after an early-morning gym session. With increased blood flow to the brain, you'll feel more energized and focused rather than sluggish and unenthusiastic. If your job involves sitting at a desk for long periods of time, be sure to find time to do simple exercises to kickstart the brain every so often, and it will make a real difference to your day."

      "Are your teenagers favorite pastimes verging on becoming addictions? Learn to recognize the signs and plan to step in if things seem to be getting out of hand.",
      "1. Junk Food",
      "Good luck finding a teenager who dutifully eats his or her vegetables. They're an anomaly. Teenagers have a tendency to spend their limited independence and pocket money eating junk food and unhealthy snacks with their friends. This is completely normal and not always cause for concern, especially since many teenagers are active.",
      "However, if your teenager is not active and won't maintain a healthy, well-rounded diet, you'll need to start watching what you put on the dinner table. Unfortunately, in our junk food culture many parents underestimate the health consequences of a poor diet in their children until said children face obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and more. Bad eating habits that start early in life can lead to health problems that your teenager will have a difficult time amending in adulthood. Thoroughly explain the adverse effects of a poor diet.",
      "2. Social Media",
      "Social Media",
      "Social media portrays unrealistic ideals. People rarely post photos of themselves when they're sick or in their sweatpants. Teenagers who spend most of their time on social media, either looking at the image projected by others or attempting to project an ideal image of themselves, may wind up with confidence problems.",
      "Combining artificially inflated lives with the potential for cyberbullying of those who don't fit an unrealistic image is a potentially catastrophic combination. Remind your teenager that people only post what they want others to see, and that unplugging and living in the real world is the only way to make a fair assessment of life.",
      "3. Alcohol",
      "It's no secret that teenagers have a tendency to experiment with alcohol. Many teenagers have a desire to feel like adults and cannot conceptualize just how significant the difference between the legal drinking age and the age of a high school student is.",
      "If you catch your teenager drinking, handle the problem immediately. If you catch your teenager drinking multiple times, more serious intervention may be necessary. It's much easier for college students to access alcohol than it is for teenagers, making it necessary to stop the problem before college years begin.",
      "4. Casual Drug Use",
      "Teenagers often dabble with relatively mild drugs, such as marijuana. Even though marijuana doesn't seem so severe in the grand scheme of things, it's important to utilize any opportunity you can to open up a running dialogue about drug use. If left unchecked, even occasional mild drug use may lead to an exploratory process that leads to full blown drug addiction. Teenagers are still developing, and they don't always have the foresight to know that making a risky decision one time can set them on an undesirable course for the rest of their lives. Be honest with your children about the impact drugs can have. Teach your teenagers from a young age to invest in themselves, and they'll be better suited to make wise decisions in their futures.",
      "5. Video Gaming",
      "Video games changed the way that kids spend their leisure time. They're no longer going out to climb trees or ride their bikes. It's more fun, comfortable, and convenient to sit inside and interact with a screen. There's nothing inherently wrong with gaming – it's fun, and it even comes with numerous benefits. Video games only become a problem when they're your teenager's sole activity. If he or she is slipping in school, losing sleep, or declining in health due to video games becoming a primary life priority, it's time to unplug. You might be able to introduce your teenager to a healthier, more active hobby.",
      "Addictions come in many shapes and sizes. If you notice any obsessive or unhealthy fixations creeping their way into your teenager's life, sit down and talk about it. Many teenagers dread speaking with their parents, but a casual approach with a healthy dose of understanding might help bridge important gaps. If you do not react quickly enough you might soon find yourself helping your teenage son or daughter as they are trying to bounce back to the real world after an addiction. It is much better to tackle the problem early, before what seems like an innocent hobby or past time activity turns into a life obsession.",

That said, one thing that hasn't changed is people's individuality in learning, with some finding that it just comes naturally whilst others face an uphill struggle to process the same information.",
      "Individuals all have their own 'optimised state' in which they learn most effectively and this can be influenced by a variety of factors. Employers who are savvy enough to recognise the importance of individual learning patterns can utilise this knowledge to their advantage, as increasing the ability of employees to absorb, process, retain and recall information can lead to transformative results in productivity, efficiency and morale.",
      "Understanding different learning environments",
      "One of the ways in which an employer can help staff to improve their learning potential is through providing an optimal learning environment; however, due to the vast array of differences between individuals, it may be impossible to cater for everyone. Additionally, environments can and do change regularly and, given the diversity of work in modern businesses, employees could find themselves having to learn at different office locations, whilst travelling, at home or in co-working spaces. Therefore, a key element in mastering successful learning is also understanding how to be productive in any environment, rather than procrastinating and constantly waiting for the 'perfect' situation to present itself before getting started.",
      "Understanding different learning styles is the first step in mastering the ability to learn in any setting. It helps to identify what elements should be recreated and what influences will be most effective for an individual.",
      "Common learning styles",
      "Kinaesthetic - This means that the individual learns better with 'hands on' experience as they retain information best by actually carrying out the task, even if it's in a 'trial and error' situation.",
      "Visual - These individuals can learn best visually, for example in diagrams. However it's the symbolism that these learners work best with; any form of colour or imagery will truly catch their attention and help them remember.",
      "Aural - This is the group of people that learn best when taught verbally, whether that be via general discussions or directly spoken to.",
      "Linguistic - In this category, individuals learn best by taking the information they've read and re-writing it up in whatever form they prefer.",
      "Multimodal - These individuals take in information well through all forms of learning, although in some cases may have to go through each form in order to truly learn the information they've been presented with.",
      "By empowering employees to take control of their own learning, organisations can effectively upskill their existing workforce, improve motivation and boost productivity. Employees who quickly see the results of investing in their own learning and memory will realise the benefits both personally and for the organisation, leading to greater adoption of the practices which have resulted in higher performance.",
      "Good mental health and wellbeing",
      "Whilst creating optimal conditions for learning is vital, of equal importance is good mental health and wellbeing, as employees who are stressed, mentally unwell or are physically exhausted will be unable to learn effectively. In addition to providing adequate mental health and wellbeing provisions in the workplace, it is also useful to include relaxation exercises or brief meditations before embarking on training sessions to help employees to clear their mind, relax and focus on the tasks ahead."

      "A common technique which applies across multiple learning types is the art of questioning. Consider how easy it is to get engrossed in a novel compared to trying to memorise the contents of a textbook; this is because when reading the novel, your mind is constantly trying to decide what is going to happen next, creating theories and then reading on to find out whether you were right or wrong. This same pattern of questioning can be applied to any information which needs to be learned and retained. Building questions into the learning process and encouraging employees to challenge themselves with questions or predictions can help to keep employees engaged for longer, whilst also helping them to retain more information. If they have predicted the right answers, they will be pleased with themselves and remember that success. If they were wrong, they're actually more likely to remember it, along with the right answers for next time, as nobody likes to be wrong!",
      "In summary, understanding the basics of how people learn is critical to developing strategies and environments which will help employees to learn most effectively and be most productive whilst avoiding unnecessary distractions. Understanding that not all employees will benefit from the same combination of factors and helping them to identify their own preferred learning style will empower them to take control of their own learning, thereby improving their own abilities and career prospects whilst also benefiting the organisation. When supplemented with effective stress management and relaxation strategies to minimise any emotional distractions, an organisation will be well on its way to developing teams and departments that are consistently working at peak performance."

      "July 2019 - Although you may believe that your mental health is purely impacted by your environment and surroundings, many mental health problems can be worsened by poor lifestyles. In fact, many doctors often prescribe lifestyle factors such as exercise and a good diet as part of treatments for illnesses such as depression and anxiety.",
      "Lack of exercise",
      "Only 22.9% of adults in the US get enough exercise according to the CDC, and this can have a large impact on both their physical and mental health. Although exercise is related to lifestyle improvements, such as weight loss and the reduction of physical illnesses such as heart conditions, there is also a lot of evidence to show that exercise can have as much of an effect of prescription drugs on illnesses such as depression. Exercise can help to improve the amount of vitamins that you will receive, increase the amount of serotonin in the body, the lack of which causes some cases of depression and gives you the opportunity to explore nature.",
      "Low-quality diets",
      "Over 1 in 4 people experience a mental health problem at any one time across the world, and 1 in 6 have experienced symptoms of a mental health problem in the past week. However, there is now also evidence to suggest that mental health can be impacted by poor diet, with sources suggesting that cases of depression can rise up to 80% in teens with the lowest quality diets. Eating regularly and well can help boost your nutritional and energy levels, which can increase your mood, along with superfoods such as omega oils which have been proven to increase mood. Not only this, but food with a high sugar level can give you mood swings from the amount of adrenalin and fast burning carbohydrates flooding your bloodstream.",
      "What can you do to change this?",

Seek emotional help from family and friends, and mental health advice from doctors and practitioners, in order to feel the support around you as you undertake your road to recovery."

Living a healthy lifestyle and eating properly is great, and filling in the gaps with the effective supplements below is even better. There is a lot of controversy surrounding the effectiveness of supplements on long term function, and although research is mixed, the popular belief is that many of these supplements can help to boost memory, creativity, motivation and general brain functioning. Below we have a list of a few of the supplements that you should either try or avoid!",

      "The Omega-3 Fatty Acids found in fish oils are believed to play a vital role in maintaining the function and structure of the brain, and it is found within brain cells. It also has anti-inflammatory effects that can protect against damage and ageing. It isn't necessarily associated with improved brain function, yet, for people with mental health issues such as depression, it is known to improve mood. Find your Omega-3 in fish and other seafood, particularly cold-water fatty fish such as tuna, salmon and mackerel. Taking EPA fish oil is especially important if you don't eat much fish, or none at all. Regardless of your diet, taking fish oils can be very useful.",

      "Supplements on the market can often make rather vague claims about the effects they can have which can really mislead consumers. Also, often, there isn’t any proof of the positive effects that the products claim to have. Prevagen is a supplement that is said to contain an ingredient that is derived from jellyfish and is said to support cognitive function. However, there is no proof of there being any well-designed studies to test the effectiveness of the supplement. This is an example of the money-fuelled side of pharmaceuticals, so perhaps give this one a miss.",
      "Try - Ginkgo Biloba",
      "Researchers believe that ginkgo can improve cognitive function as it encourages a good circulation of blood in the brain, and protects it from damage. It has been suggested that it can reduce symptoms of psychiatric disorders, anxiety and depression, as well as dementia and healthy brain function in general. It is also thought to contain powerful antioxidants. However, it is thought that the benefits of ginkgo may only really apply to older people, so consider this before purchasing."

It has been heavily criticised in the past, but it actually can be very healthy and beneficial when consumed in moderation. Caffeine found in coffee stimulates the central nervous system, as it prevents adenosine from slowing you down and makes you feel alert. In terms of actual brain function, it has been suggested that caffeine can improve mood, general mental function, vigilance and also memory. Researchers are still debating the effects of caffeine on long term-memory, yet it has found that caffeine may enhance short-term memory. Other studies, however, have shown no effects on memory at all. Aside from the perceived benefits on memory, the other benefits it can have for the brain make it certainly worth trying."

    ],
    longDescription: [
      "HIV stigma is something that's partially rooted in myths and partially rooted in misunderstandings. Even though education about HIV and AIDS is relatively widespread, people are still confused about exactly how difficult it is to contract HIV. These factors culminate to make social relationships in the workplace, the learning environment, and sometimes the home lives of people with HIV unnecessarily difficult. If you or someone you know is living with HIV, you have the power to take a few simple steps to help eradicate the stigma.",
      "When People Don't Have to Disclose Their Status",
      "If you have HIV, your status only needs to be disclosed in a medical context and to any sexual partners you may have. You do not necessarily need to disclose your HIV status to your employer unless you're working a field where bodily fluids may be exchanged, such as a medically related profession. An office job won't necessarily require a disclosure to be made, and you're only obligated to disclose this information to your employer in the event that you're injured in the workplace or cannot perform certain duties as a result of your HIV status. If you work with someone with HIV, it's not uncommon that you'd never hear about it.",
      "In most first world countries, people with HIV are a protected class. The illness is considered a disability and is thus protected under discrimination laws. You can choose to disclose this information to your employer, and they cannot terminate your employment because of your status. If you are a manager or a coworker of someone who is living with HIV, remind others that treating an affected individual unfairly could be classified as workplace discrimination.",
      "Choosing to Be Open",
      "When you decide to tell people that you're living with HIV, you're making a brave move. Many people will be understanding. They won't have an irrational fear that they can contract HIV from sharing a bathroom or a drinking glass with you. They might have powerful reservations because they're afraid of the virus and fail to realize how difficult it is to contract HIV from a nonsexual or nonmedical relationship with someone. If you know someone with HIV, never tell anyone on their behalf. Even if they're generally open about it, remember that it can be perceived as insensitive to disclose someone else's HIV status.",
      "Educating Others",
      "When you decide to educate others about HIV, you're making a positive impact on society as a whole. Ideally, we would live in a world where everyone is informed and rational when it comes to HIV, but we can't get there unless we're willing to educate the people around us.",
      "You can either speak from personal experience and understanding about HIV, or you can direct people to independent resources. Many STD and HIV related charities share helpful information on their websites. YouTube users with HIV often document their journeys and create explainer videos for those who have some learning to do. It all depends on what you're most comfortable doing. If you aren't yet ready to be the one doing all the talking, you can just as easily point people in the direction of someone who has already said what you want them to know."

    longDescription: [
      "Depression is fairly common. Chances are, someone you know is struggling with depression. If this person is close to you, you probably want to do all you can to improve the way they feel. Though depression is far from rare, it's still commonly misunderstood. When you want to be as helpful as possible, you need to make sure you truly understand the person you're trying to uplift.",
      "1. Avoid Common Stereotypes",
      "Things like sunshine, fresh air, and a positive mindset are great. These things may not be attainable or helpful to people with depression. Depression is a disorder, rather than a fleeting feeling. Trying to spread a little cheer and treating depression as something lighthearted might make your friend feel like you're diminishing their inner struggle, which is the exact opposite of what you're trying to do.",
      "2. Don't Treat Them Any Differently",
      "One of the worst things you can do is change the way you treat your friend with depression. Neglecting to invite them to your birthday party because you have a feeling they won't want to come might make them feel excluded - even if you thought about their imminent rejection to the invitation.",
      "Focusing on their sadness all the time will only make them focus on their sadness more. Talk about the same things you always talk about. Go to your favorite places together, and send them the same funny text messages. You'll be providing a sense of normalcy in their life, which is important when someone feels down.",
      "3. Understand They May Not Want the Same Things",
      "Depression can suddenly change a person. They may not feel as extroverted as they once used to. Your friend with depression might have been the life of the party, but now they're more comfortable at home on their couch. If they don't want to go out, come to them. You might have to take the initiative when your friend has become a little more withdrawn.",
      "4. Support Them In The Things They Love",
      "People with depression sometimes lose touch with hobbies or interests that once made them happy. Depression creates something like a cloud that makes joy feel unattainable or foggy at times. If your depressed friend loved writing, get them a small gift for writers. Send them a small care package that's tailored to their hobbies just to let them know you were thinking of them. If he or she was an avid gardener, offer to come over and help harvest their vegetables. It's a small and supportive push in the right direction.",
      "5. Make Yourself Available",
      "Let your friend with depression know that you're always there. Even if they don't take you up on the offer, it could be comforting to know that they have someone to turn to if things feel especially dark and lonely. Let them know they can talk to you whenever they need to, and you're there to listen without judgement.",
      "6. Don't Get Offended",
      "Your friend with depression may not want to talk or hang out. The worst thing you could do would be to become pushy or act offended. Your friend might not understand how or why they upset you. They're dealing with a lot of their own sad feelings, and they don't want to feel responsible for yours as well. Your friend may cancel plans from time to time or fail to answer a phone call. Just give them some time.",
      "7. Keep Yourself Healthy",
      "You can't be your best for other people if you aren't your best for yourself. Throwing yourself with full force at other people's depression might lead to compassion fatigue, which can in turn become your own depression. Remember that you aren't a therapist. Be prepared to point your friend to resources they might need if they truly require the help of a professional.",
      "True friendships can withstand a lot - including depression. Be patient, forgiving, and present when your friend struggling with depression needs it the most."

What you have left is your spending budget. You can install an app on your phone to keep tracking of your spending - once you see how much money you are giving away, you will realise you need to cut down. You can also even set up a direct debit which goes from your bank account to your savings account as soon as you get paid."

Importune naps can disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to loss of sleep and peculiar patterns of appetite.

      "it seems that everyone in the world will before long be suffering from depression, or some form of anxiety disorder. Not good. Science and psychiatry are, it seems, a little divided on the issue. Various theories as to the source of the problem have been put forward, but there is as yet no real consensus. Some do not even believe that the problem is real, attributing the statistical rise to diagnostic improvements and a change in culture. So what, if anything, is going on? What do people think is behind this problem?",
      "The Internet",
      "One of the most common theories holds that the rise in internet usage has - directly or indirectly - brought a host of mental health problems in its wake. The theorized abilities of the internet to change our brains and trigger neurosis are multiform, and a whole book could be written on the phenomenon. Briefly, however, here are some of the more common points made:",
      "The internet causes addiction. Many scientists, particularly in Asia (where it's a big problem) believe that the dopamine surge caused by receiving information, validation, and 'rewards' through gameplay via the internet can cause pathological usage and addiction. This naturally alters the brain's chemistry, predisposing many heavy internet users to anxieties and depressive states. It's an as-yet little understood phenomenon, but people are taking it seriously - so much so that many health insurers are adding internet addiction to the list of things they cover.",
      "The internet reduces our 'mental downtime'. Instead of relaxing when we get home, we log immediately into the internet, over-stimulating our brains with both work and leisure, and effectively preventing them from getting the vital rest they need to start processing the emotions and experiences of the day. This ultimately leads to mental health problems like depression.",
      "The internet feeds us a lot of depressing news, and makes us periodically angry (more on that later).",
      "The internet (and social media in particular) puts us under subliminal pressure to achieve a standardized 'perfection' - showing us the carefully tailored social media streams of our friends, which appear to show a 'perfect' life to which we cannot possibly live up. This is all of course heavily edited and a 'glossy' version of the actual (more mundane) truth, but it nonetheless causes a good deal of insecurity and feelings of worthlessness.",
      "Urbanization",
      "The world has reached an unprecedented landmark. By 2017, it's thought that the majority of people will be living in urban areas. In the past, the majority of people worldwide have always lived in small rural communities - with urban centres making up a significant population proportion, but never greater than the whole sum of humanity. Now, however, the cities are expanding and more people are moving to them. This, it is thought, increases depression risk in a number of ways:",
      "Lack of access to 'green spaces'. It's by now well known that our mental health is significantly boosted by time spent outdoors, preferably in green, leafy spaces. The urban environment and lifestyle makes doing this much harder - and even those who regularly enjoy parks may lack the kind of distraction-free experience gained by those in the countryside, due to the presence of lots of other people.",
      "Anonymity. In small, rural communities, people are known to one another, and are often cared for by the community should things go wrong. While many urban communities are very cohesive, it is nonetheless more common to experience 'anonymity' in cities. When nobody really knows who you are, and you lack a sense of 'place', 'tribe', or general human connection, it is easy to succumb to feelings of worthlessness and depression.",
      "Stress. Everyday urban life tends to be more 'high powered' and stressful than rural life. Negotiating traffic, constant noise, enhanced crime rates, busy jobs... all of these enhance an urban-dweller's risk of stress, which in turn raises their risk of developing depression.",
      "Lifestyle",
      "It's no secret that we're becoming increasingly sedentary, and eating an increasingly poor diet. Without good cardiovascular health (as is bestowed by regular exercise), our brains are less able to receive nourishment from the blood. And without the right kind of diet, that nourishment which they do receive is sub-par and unable to fulfil all of the brain's requirements to keep our mental and emotional health at a reasonable equilibrium. It's thought that dietary and general lifestyle improvements could make an enormous difference to the global mental health situation."

All of this serves to make us more anxious, and renders our ruminations rather more negative than would otherwise be the case.",

The theorized abilities of the internet to change our brains and trigger neurosis are multiform, and a whole book could be written on the phenomenon. Briefly, however, here are some of the more common points made:",
      "The internet causes addiction. Many scientists, particularly in Asia (where it's a big problem) believe that the dopamine surge caused by receiving information, validation, and 'rewards' through gameplay via the internet can cause pathological usage and addiction. This naturally alters the brain's chemistry, predisposing many heavy internet users to anxieties and depressive states. It's an as-yet little understood phenomenon, but people are taking it seriously - so much so that many health insurers are adding internet addiction to the list of things they cover.",
      "The internet reduces our 'mental downtime'. Instead of relaxing when we get home, we log immediately into the internet, over-stimulating our brains with both work and leisure, and effectively preventing them from getting the vital rest they need to start processing the emotions and experiences of the day. This ultimately leads to mental health problems like depression.",
      "The internet feeds us a lot of depressing news, and makes us periodically angry (more on that later).",
      "The internet (and social media in particular) puts us under subliminal pressure to achieve a standardized 'perfection' - showing us the carefully tailored social media streams of our friends, which appear to show a 'perfect' life to which we cannot possibly live up. This is all of course heavily edited and a 'glossy' version of the actual (more mundane) truth, but it nonetheless causes a good deal of insecurity and feelings of worthlessness.",
      "Urbanization",
      "The world has reached an unprecedented landmark. By 2017, it's thought that the majority of people will be living in urban areas. In the past, the majority of people worldwide have always lived in small rural communities - with urban centres making up a significant population proportion, but never greater than the whole sum of humanity. Now, however, the cities are expanding and more people are moving to them. This, it is thought, increases depression risk in a number of ways:",
      "Lack of access to 'green spaces'. It's by now well known that our mental health is significantly boosted by time spent outdoors, preferably in green, leafy spaces. The urban environment and lifestyle makes doing this much harder - and even those who regularly enjoy parks may lack the kind of distraction-free experience gained by those in the countryside, due to the presence of lots of other people.",
      "Anonymity. In small, rural communities, people are known to one another, and are often cared for by the community should things go wrong. While many urban communities are very cohesive, it is nonetheless more common to experience 'anonymity' in cities. When nobody really knows who you are, and you lack a sense of 'place', 'tribe', or general human connection, it is easy to succumb to feelings of worthlessness and depression.",
      "Stress. Everyday urban life tends to be more 'high powered' and stressful than rural life. Negotiating traffic, constant noise, enhanced crime rates, busy jobs... all of these enhance an urban-dweller's risk of stress, which in turn raises their risk of developing depression."

And without the right kind of diet, that nourishment which they do receive is sub-par and unable to fulfil all of the brain's requirements to keep our mental and emotional health at a reasonable equilibrium. It's thought that dietary and general lifestyle improvements could make an enormous difference to the global mental health situation.",
      "Fear",
      "There has been much talk recently about the 'politics of fear'. Media and political campaigns designed to elicit sales and votes by scaremongering have become much more common in recent years, and the stress, hatred, and anger provoked by these can have an extremely negative effect on mental health. What is more, the internet provides us with access to negative news stories in unprecedented amounts. All of this serves to make us more anxious, and renders our ruminations rather more negative than would otherwise be the case.",

In recent years, we have become far better at accepting, seeking help for, and diagnosing mental health problems - all over the world.

      "As the clock neared 1 a.m. on an evening in May, Adam Sandler walked onto Saturday Night Live’s Studio 8H stage alone. This would not be for a sketch, or even a bit of stand-up. Instead, Sandler, who was hosting for the first time since being fired from the show in 1995, picked up a black Takamine acoustic guitar and began to play a bittersweet tribute to a late friend.",
      "The first time I saw him he was sweeter than honey",
      "Plaid jacket and belt too tight and he wasn’t even being funny ",
      "Then he cartwheeled around the room and he slow-danced with the cleaning lady ",
      "He was a one-man party",
      "You know who I’m talking about, I’m talking about my friend Chris Farley",
      "With a thin five o’clock shadow covering his face, the then-52-year-old Sandler seemed to barely make it through the song without breaking down. Accompanied by a video montage of Farley’s greatest hits, the nearly five-minute ballad told the story of Sandler’s larger-than-life friend and former SNL castmate—his most memorable characters, his contradictions, his demons, his humanity, and finally, his place in history.",

      "Make my kids laugh with your YouTube clips or Tommy Boy",
      "And when they ask me who’s the funniest guy I ever knew",
      "I tell ’em hands down without a doubt it’s you",
      "That night, Jonah Hill was watching. “I was like, crying. I was crying,” he says proudly. “Sandler and the Beastie Boys, for our generation, were prime examples of how to be cool.” To boys bar mitzvahed in the 1990s—boys like Hill—the musically inclined, often filthy, laid-back but occasionally volatile comedian was a god. But Sandler’s appeal also extended well beyond overnight camp and Hebrew school carpools. In the mid-to-late ’90s, he was everyone’s favorite class clown, a man-child who could generate laughter with ease.",
      "“He had this charming-Jewish-boy-he-could-be-your-college-boyfriend-guy thing,” says Tamra Davis, who directed Sandler and Farley in Billy Madison. “There was something attractive that I saw in him. He wasn’t just a repulsive guy. He had a heart in this weird way.”",
      "If Sandler was a relatable mensch with the ability to explode for comedic effect, then Farley was his inverse, an intensely hilarious force with the subtle ability to be almost painfully sweet. Built like an interior lineman and nimble like a ballet dancer, he did anything he could to make people laugh. “He would scare me,” Davis says. “That was how his comedy was. He would push it so far to the edge that you didn’t know if he was gonna just crash into the wall or jump off the stage. He wasn’t just a regular, ‘I’m in control’ comedian. He was like Kurt Cobain.”",
      "A decade ago, while filming Funny People with Sandler and Hill, Seth Rogen could barely shake his reverence. “We were like, ‘It’s crazy. He’s right over there,’” Rogen told Parade magazine in 2009. “‘Adam knows our names. That’s awesome.’”",
      "Toward the end of his ode to Farley, Sandler’s voice cracked, and as he strummed the song’s final chord, the SNL audience erupted in emotion. “Not. A. Dry. Eye. In. The. House,” Leslie Jones tweeted that night. It’s not difficult to understand why: The song temporarily opened a portal to a time when the two buddies appeared poised to take over big-screen comedy. But it also served as a stark reminder that only one of them actually did.",
      "After Wayne’s World became a phenomenon in 1992, it spawned a handful of comedies based on Saturday Night Live characters. The problem was that none of those films, with maybe the exception of Wayne’s World 2, were any good. At the same time, some of the series’ most famous alums, who throughout the ’80s carried blockbuster after blockbuster, had started to fade from relevance. Bill Murray did make a masterpiece in Groundhog Day (1993) and Eddie Murphy continued to churn out hits like Boomerang (1992) and Beverly Hills Cop III (1994), but the late-night-to-Hollywood pipeline was clogged. Mike Myers aside, SNL’s status as a launching pad for movie stars was in doubt.",
      "By the mid-’90s, no one was rushing to anoint Sandler and Farley—who, along with Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Julia Sweeney, and Tim Meadows, had joined the SNL cast in 1990. Instead, each had to take a winding path to stardom.",
      "Farley was born in 1964 in Madison, Wisconsin, where he grew up in an Irish Catholic family with four siblings. At a young age, he pulled pranks but usually managed to completely disarm whoever his mischief pissed off. In the biography The Chris Farley Show, his brother Tom tells a story about Chris peeing in cups because he was too lazy to walk from his bedroom to the toilet, a habit his mother, Mary Anne, discovered and informed his father, Thomas Sr., about. The next day at the dinner table, as everyone sat silently waiting for dad to yell at the offender, Tom Sr. took a sip of water. “You’re not gonna drink out of that glass, are you?” Chris asked. “Goddammit!” his dad shouted back.",
      "“Chris knew what was coming,” Tom Jr., who cowrote the biography with Tanner Colby, says in the book, “but he had to get the laugh first.”",
      "At Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart, Farley played football and resisted teachers’ calls for him to act in plays. When he attended Marquette University, however, his interest in theater grew. On campus, he gained a well-earned reputation as a funnyman and an epic partier. By that point, the late John Belushi had become his hero. Bob Woodward’s Belushi biography, Wired, is said to be the only book he read in college; infamous for focusing more on the SNL icon’s drug use than for his greatness as a performer, it deeply affected Farley. As a teenager, Chris already had begun binge drinking; alcoholism ran in the family. “Chris wasn’t blindly imitating Belushi,” his buddy Jim Murphy says in The Chris Farley Show, “but reading that book validated all the addictions and impulses that Chris already had inside of him.”",
      "For the rest of his life, Farley dealt with addiction. And though his comedic persona wasn’t at all the product of his substance misuse, the two went hand in hand. “He committed to everything he did,” his friend Charna Halpern, cofounder of ImprovOlympic, once told the Chicago Tribune, “and there was no halfway.”",
      "While entertaining his rugby teammates at Marquette, Farley realized that he wanted to pursue a comedy career. He graduated in 1986 after four and a half years—an incident in which he accidentally almost burned down a house with a smoke bomb landed him on probation and forced him to finish his degree at the University of Wisconsin—and then briefly worked for his father. Shortly after that, he gathered up the courage to start performing at Madison’s Ark Improvisational Theatre. Soon, he moved to Chicago, where he shined at ImprovOlympic and then the famed improv theater The Second City. In 1989, he was promoted to the company’s main stage. As a member of the troupe, he began playing a motivational speaker named Matt Foley. Written for him by Bob Odenkirk and named for a college friend, the loud, vulnerable, furniture-breaking character who lived “in a van down by the river!” perfectly highlighted Farley’s talents—and created a considerable amount of buzz. In 1990, SNL’s executive producer, Lorne Michaels, went to Chicago to see Farley in action; just months later, the comedian was hired as a cast member.",
      "The same year, Sandler joined the series as a writer before being added to the cast midseason. Like Farley, he grew up adoring Saturday Night Live—even though he often fell asleep while waiting for it to start. Both comedians came from close families, but their backgrounds differed. Born in 1966 in Brooklyn and raised in Manchester, New Hampshire, Sandler was the performative darling of his Jewish parents, Stan and Judy. “They definitely told me, ‘You can do this,’” Sandler said in January on Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend. “‘You can play guitar, you can sing, you can’t dance.’ I tried to dance a little bit to be the triple threat that my grandmother said I should be. But they said to eliminate the dancing.",
      "Sandler’s comic timing came in before puberty. At movies as an elementary-schooler, he used to scream at the screen. “I’d always say like five jokes, and there would be four power laughs,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1994. “And then the fifth one I would say, ‘Hey, nice hair!’ or something like that, and somebody would go, ‘Hey, shut up!’ and then it would just take away the other four jokes I killed on—everyone turned on me.”",
      "By the time he was a teen with dreams of show business, Sandler was unshakably confident. “I was nuts,” he told O’Brien, referring to his penchant for telling his childhood friends that he “was gonna be huge” and that “people are starting to notice.” At the time, no one was. At least not yet.",
      "That gradually changed while he was attending New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. Tim Herlihy, his college roommate and future writing partner, remembers bonding with Sandler over their love of Caddyshack and Mel Brooks movies. From their sixth-floor dorm room on 10th Street, they’d stick a mirror out the window and direct sunlight onto pedestrians. “Hey baldy!” Herlihy recalls Sandler yelling at one unsuspecting hairless gentleman. “The meaner it was and the more random the victim,” Herlihy adds, “the harder we laughed.”",
      "As an NYU student, Sandler began honing his seemingly anxiety-free stand-up act. “He made comedy cool,” says writer Fred Wolf, who’s been collaborating with Sandler for three decades. “He was able to be effortless, just kind of had a laid-back cool to him. And then when he lost his temper, it got loud. He was hilarious.”",
      "Sandler parlayed his success as a comedian into a few substantial gigs: a role as Theo’s friend Smitty on The Cosby Show and a recurring spot on the MTV game show Remote Control. Then, after graduating from NYU in 1988, Sandler moved to Los Angeles, where he eventually caught Michaels’s eye. The producer enjoyed his silly, mostly impression-free act, a rarity in those days. “I’m great at humping a chair,” Sandler said in 1994. “That’s what got me Saturday Night Live. I was in Lorne’s office humping his chair and he said, ‘My God, that’s funny, you’re hired—seven-year contract.’”",
      "On October 27, 1990, four episodes into his first season on Saturday Night Live, a shirtless Farley shimmied his way into America’s heart. That evening, he and host Patrick Swayze played dancers auditioning for the Chippendales. Written by the legendary James Downey, the sketch features a half-naked Farley confidently showing off moves, completely unencumbered by his size—or by the fact that his competition is the guy from Dirty Dancing.",
      "Today, the legacy of the skit is still up for debate. SNL writer Robert Smigel, for one, said in The Chris Farley Show that he thought that the judges’ earnest consideration of Farley as a sexy dancer prevents the bit from being exploitative. Chris Rock, on the other hand, disagrees. “I always hated it,” he said in the book. “The joke of it is basically, ‘We can’t hire you because you’re fat.’ I mean, he’s a fat guy, and you’re going to ask him to dance with no shirt on. OK. That’s enough. You’re gonna get that laugh. But when he stops dancing you have to turn it in his favor. There’s no turn there. There’s no comic twist to it. It’s just fucking mean.”",
      "What’s not up for debate is the extent to which the Chippendales skit put Farley on the map. And while Farley struggled with body image issues, he was never afraid to play up his weight as a way to make audiences laugh.",
      "Many of Farley’s funniest characters required the big man to throw his body around a room, but his outsized energy, not just his physical size, made him hysterical. In “Bill Swerski’s Super Fans,” he stole the show as a delusionally optimistic, mustached Bears diehard with a thick Chicago accent. “He had that physicality, that swag, that just put it over,” George Wendt, one of the fellow Super Fans, told me in 2018. “He could say anything, and then with his body language, it would just be hilarious. ‘How are ya, Bob?’ It’s not a joke at all unless it’s Farley.”",
      "Farley brought Matt Foley to SNL, too; in the character’s first appearance on the show, as he yelled and adjusted his belt mere inches from their faces, host Christina Applegate, David Spade, and even the unflappable Phil Hartman could barely keep themselves from laughing. Still, nothing quite captured Farley’s self-deprecating charm like “The Chris Farley Show.” On the mock interview program, he nervously chatted with celebrities, smacking himself on the head and pulling his hair after asking dumb questions. His childlike tenderness was so strong that his guests, including Paul McCartney, would fall for him anyway."

      " Sandler’s value to the show wasn’t nearly as apparent as Farley’s—compared to his scene-stealing buddy, he was a subtle presence. But he had an approach that didn’t resemble what anyone else was doing in sketch comedy at the time, and a voice that was his, and his alone. “I thought that Sandler brought a really great breath of fresh air to the show and relaxed the show when it was getting kind of uptight and formulaic,” Odenkirk, a longtime writer on SNL, said in James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales’s Live From New York: The Complete, Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live. “So I liked what Adam did. But I think his fame or his success did surprise maybe everybody.”",
      "As the faux-Italian Opera Man, Sandler displayed an impressive vocal range while singing about current events. With Canteen Boy and Cajun Man, he relied on a formula that served him well over the years: funny voice plus weird facial expression equals laughs. But what truly made Sandler a household name was his music. His holiday celebrations “The Thanksgiving Song” and, to an even greater extent, “The Hanukkah Song,” ended up getting airplay around the country. (During the holidays, radio stations still play them.) And for his performance of “Lunch Lady Land,” Farley dressed up as the title character and danced around the stage. In 1993, Sandler got his first taste of massive success, going platinum with his comedy album They’re All Gonna Laugh at You!, which featured several of his songs—and taught millions of kids how to curse creatively."

In a post–Wayne’s World world, Sandler and Farley showed that maybe SNL cast members other than Mike Myers did have movie star potential. Their modest success also proved that in the wake of Jim Carrey’s rise and whatever it was that Pauly Shore was doing, there remained an appetite for gleefully adolescent humor. After all, the country’s middle-schoolers weren’t ready for the spate of more sophisticated, sometimes R-rated teen movies about to arrive. But they loved Sandler and Farley.",
      "After Billy Madison and Tommy Boy, Sandler and Farley should’ve returned to Saturday Night Live as conquering heroes. Instead, they found themselves portrayed as symptoms of a show in shambles. Ratings had dipped, and the sophomoric Bad Boys of SNL, of which the two buddies were a part, had led to a critical backlash. Whatever magic the two comedians had found on the big screen—in movies that perhaps skewed toward a younger demographic that wasn’t tuning in to late-night television every Saturday—was no longer translating to the adult-focused SNL. The March 13, 1995, cover of New York magazine featured a photograph of Farley with the shell of an old TV set on his head.

Sandler made Happy Gilmore, about a hockey-playing “blue-collar moron” who becomes a professional golfer. Farley, meanwhile, appeared to have even more options than his pal—he was in talks to star in The Cable Guy and Kingpin—but Paramount, which had signed him to a two-picture contract, nixed those opportunities. Instead, the studio quickly slotted him into Black Sheep. Written by Wolf and directed by Penelope Spheeris, it wasn’t a sequel to Tommy Boy, but with Farley playing the goofball brother of a gubernatorial candidate opposite David Spade’s straightlaced campaign staffer, it certainly felt like a rehash.",
      "Within two weeks in February 1996, Black Sheep and Happy Gilmore came out. Each cleared $30 million in theaters. And then, all of a sudden, Sandler became comedy’s box office king. “You look back on it now and it seems like it’s, ‘Bam, bam, bam,’” says Herlihy, who’s written 11 of Sandler’s movies. “In real time, it was in such slow motion.” His two movies in 1998, rom-com The Wedding Singer and underdog football flick The Waterboy, combined to make $309.3 million. The next year, he starred in Big Daddy, which raked in $234.8 million. While Sandler’s sense of humor never radically evolved—he’s still making versions of the movies that he made in the ’90s—he managed to adapt his shtick so that it fit in broader, more heartfelt comedies. He grew up, but not enough to alienate his core audience. “He started out with Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore and that’s what really what put him on the map,” says Peter Segal, who directed Sandler in a string of early-2000s hits: Anger Management, 50 First Dates, and The Longest Yard. “And then he matured and became a man in these roles.”",
      "In a just world, Farley would’ve been right there with his friend. But unlike Sandler, he was never able to find subsequent projects that truly showcased his talents. He did discuss playing Fatty Arbuckle—the silent film star who was wrongfully accused of rape and manslaughter in the early 1920s, and with whom Farley felt a deep connection—in a biopic, and he also recorded a pathos-filled vocal track for Shrek. “Rossio and Elliott, who wrote Shrek, told me that they patterned Shrek and Donkey after Farley and Spade in Tommy Boy,” Segal says. “That’s the prototype. That’s why they wanted Chris.” But neither film panned out for him. Instead, Farley made the silly Beverly Hills Ninja, which tapped into his physical comedy but failed to burst the “fatty falls down” bubble in which he’d always been confi"

Since his death, there have been many tributes to the comedian, though most can be distilled to how Segal (and Sandler’s SNL tribute) describes him: “There was nobody funnier on the planet.”or many aspiring comedic actors growing up in the ’90s, Adam Sandler’s career and approach was the mold. “He’s the best example of someone you looked up to when you were young,” Jonah Hill affirms. But Chris Farley was different. What he had was impossible to replicate—and, twistedly, tragically, impossible to truly capture on film.",
      "Once, while walking through Studio 8H, Wolf ran into a brand-new Saturday Night Live cast member. “I’m like, ‘Hey, man, what’s going on?’” the writer recalls. “And he’s like, ‘Oh, I’m just watching Farley out there. Look at him.’” Farley, who after leaving the show had returned to the set to visit, was out on the monologue mark doing pratfalls for the veteran crew. “I don’t have that. He’s like a hurricane.” That SNL novice? His name was Will Ferrell.",

And sometimes it feels like the dark side is winning.Get a bunch of professional comedians in a room and you're probably going to be looking at a sad sack of potatoes. Or worse, a bunch of psychos. A study from the British Journal of Psychology found that comedians are more likely than others to admit to being easily distracted, antisocial, and compulsive and have less interest in connecting with other humans. Most of us would look at those qualities and say, \"Sooo, comedians are kind of introverted?\" Psychologists look at them and say, \"CRAZY!\" Probably because psychologists are still mad about flunking out of comedy school.

    ],
    longDescription: [
      "Unlike his past few specials, C.K. filmed this one in a comedy club. Why? Because, C.K. wrote, clubs are “where comedy, standup comedy, truly lives.” These are the places where comedians “say wicked, crazy, silly, wrongful, delightful, upside-down, careless, offensive, disgusting, whimsical things.” When a comic performs at a club, it’s late and everyone’s drinking, he noted. “These are the things we do when we are DONE working and being citizens.”",
      "But this paean to the after-hours freedom of the night club doesn’t entirely get at why a great comic like C.K. is hailed as a “genius” in glossy magazines and is asked about being a “philosopher-king” by Charlie Rose. To understand that, consider the joke-writing process that C.K. describes later in the e-mail. In Los Angeles, where the New York-based C.K. filmed the special, he would do “twenty minutes of new material” at alternative venues and get “cheered on by the young, open and adaptive crowds” there. Then he would take those jokes to the Improv, “where the more basic and average character of the audience would cut the new material down to about three jokes.” And then he’d take those three to the famous Comedy Store, where, he writes, “maybe ONE of those jokes would get a chuckle.” That’s the keeper.",
      "Fiction writers and poets workshop their material, but they do so, typically, in small rooms full of other writers, often led by luminaries in the field. When, after test screenings, filmmakers recut their movies for the “more basic and average,” the practice is generally bemoaned. But comedians are seen as honest populists: laughter, we think, not only feels good but teases out universal truths. It doesn’t, necessarily: we laugh at all kinds of things for all kinds of reasons. (Among the things we laugh at in comedy clubs, according to C.K.: “Intentionally false and misleading argument.… Half truths. Non-truths. Broad and hilariously wrongful generalizations.”) But there’s a notion that comics, by honing their material so that it can work almost anywhere with almost anyone, discover something essential and true in the process. We may be suspicious of lyricism and dubious of a gripping plot, but jokes—jokes are for real."

He tells some good stories about death—a favorite subject—describing the passing of a family dog as “a dry run for Grandma,” so that when she goes, he can simply remind his kids about what happened with the dog and say, “Yeah, so, Grandma now.” But the special lacks the kind of standout moment that you share with your friends the next day and that changes how you think about something."

      "Life-changing accidents are those which alter your way of life permanently – usually through injury to your person. They're shocking, disruptive, and difficult to process, and that's exactly why it's important to take responsible steps towards your recovery as soon as possible. In the case of sustaining an injury in the workplace, you're going to need to take the steps outlined in this article – steps that'll ensure you're able to hit the ground running with both your recovery and your attitude. Here’s what you'll need to do.Immediate Aftermath",
      "In the immediate aftermath of your injury sustained in the workplace, you're going to need medical attention. If your injury is a serious one, there's little doubt that you'll be going to the hospital in the back of an ambulance. In other less serious cases, asking a co-worker to give you a lift to the hospital is your best bet. Whatever you do, don't delay in getting medical attention - a difference of hours can make a huge difference in terms of your overall recovery time.",
      "Changing Responsibilities",
      "Now that you've been seen to and the life-changing elements of your injury are becoming apparent, it's time to consider your responsibilities in a new light. You may well require some time off work – something you should contact your boss about as soon as you're able to. You may also need some medical attention throughout your week, or else in-house nursing to help you recover. At this stage, it's important to consider your responsibilities - towards your work, your family, and yourself – and make plans to ensure you're not letting anyone down inadvertently through your injury.",
      "Mental and Emotional Health",
      "Possibly the biggest obstacle to your full recovery is regenerating your emotional wellbeing and your mental health following an accident that was severe enough to debilitate you, changing your life for a long time. It's easy to feel hard done by in these moments, but of course, this train of thought leads nowhere good, and it's important for you to seize the opportunity to make the most of your circumstances as soon as you can after your injury at work. Seek emotional help from family and friends, and mental health advice from doctors and practitioners, in order to feel the support around you as you undertake your road to recovery."

      "On Feb. 13, I was sitting at the desk in my bedroom where I spend a lot of time poring over half-finished novels and mostly finished pizza pockets, thinking about the 10 years I’d spent so far on a comedy career that had a way of dying and restarting like the engine of an old truck. I was unemployed, unrepresented professionally and out of money in New York. I’d spend whole days alone, reading the news, taking it way too personally.",
      "It occurred to me that of all mind-boiling aspects of the current presidential race, the worst part was arguing with people whom I considered friends. I watched people block and unfriend one another online. I spelunked into the human darkness that we call YouTube comment threads. I’d stare into the glow for hours, reading articles that supported views I had already decided were correct. I’d write angry Facebook posts, alienating myself from friends who happened to be voting for someone else. There has to be some common ground somewhere, I thought. I rattled out an opaque observation about the one thing that it seemed we could all agree on, the fact that things were getting weird.",

That theory, however, assumes that the purpose of social media is to get famous, or that there is a purpose of social media at all. Either way, I would be lying if I told anyone it didn’t feel like a win. I watched my phone explode with notifications as I lay in bed staring into its artificial light. The Internet was telling me “Yes, Jake, you are indeed funny.”",

People like John Hodgman, Bette Midler, Minnie Driver. People I watch in movies and don’t even consider real. Friends from all over the country got in touch to tell me they heard someone quote me. Someone in Britain immortalized it in needlepoint. The tweet reached easily more people than any album or podcast I’d ever produced.",
      "It’s currently sitting at around 30,000 retweets on Twitter. On a nonprofit organization’s Facebook page it got almost 60,000 likes and 45,000 shares. This one joke landed me in FunnyOrDie and Playboy. If you’re an unknown comic these are fairly big feathers in your cap."

      "During the live run of Hannah Gadsby’s standup show, Nanette, she found herself sleeping 15 hours a night, then taking naps during the day. “I got bronchitis in London,” she says. “A tooth wrenched out in Edinburgh. Then I got carbon monoxide poisoning from the flat in New York. I was Googling ‘neurological disorders’, I had the tremors and my speech was slurring. I kept telling people I was really tired, texting them coffin emojis, and they’d say: ‘Of course you are, this show is exhausting.’”",

    ],
    longDescription: [
      "She performed Nanette for 18 months – including a one-month stint in New York that turned into four – and has now become accustomed to people expressing concern for her wellbeing.",
      "We meet in a crowded Melbourne cafe, and when another journalist, early for her slot, walks by, she puts a gentle hand on Gadsby’s shoulder, unbidden. Gadsby takes this in her stride. “I’ve had psychiatrists reach out to me, saying: ‘You know, there’s no precedent for what you’re doing.’ It’s been a strange old ride and I think it’s going to take a long time before I know what I’ve done to myself.”",
      "Gadsby is keen to go incognito. The easiest way to spot her is that she is the only person in the cafe hiding their face with their hand. But anonymity may no longer be possible. Nanette went up on Netflix a month ago, and has since elicited thorough analysis in the New Yorker, the Atlantic, the Washington Post and Vanity Fair, while Lily Allen, Thandie Newton, Monica Lewinsky, Ellen Page and Roxane Gay have raved and/or wept about it on Twitter (in a tweet to Gadsby, Gay wrote: “You moved me and have really made me think about humour, the self, self-deprecation and the uses of anger”). Across Gadsby’s social networks, the general public also gives effusive thanks. Nanette is not merely an hour of standup. It’s a mass bloodletting.",
      "Gadsby can’t bring herself to look right now. In fact, she has asked her manager to mute any exciting offers. “I’m living somebody else’s dream,” she says. “Now everyone wants a piece of the Gads.”",
      "Standup comedy relies, of course, on creating tension and release. In Nanette, Gadsby exposes and then destroys that formula. She reveals experiences of homophobic and sexual violence, which escalate throughout the set, until finally she is delivering them from a precipice of rage. “This tension is yours,” she tells the stunned Sydney Opera House audience. “I am not helping you with it any more. You need to learn what this feels like.”",
      "“I broke the contract and that’s what made this work,” she says. “I betrayed people’s trust, and I did that really seriously, not just for effect.”",

      "Nanette debuted at the Melbourne International Comedy festival in 2017, the year of Australia’s same-sex marriage postal plebiscite, and during fierce debate around the Safe Schools programme designed to support LGBTQI students. Homophobia was making its way back into the public sphere; a clear, disturbing regression.",
      "In the first third of Nanette, Gadsby deconstructs the autobiographical material she has aired over the years, including a tale about nearly getting beaten up at a bus stop, which gets the audience laughing gamely. In the second, she deconstructs comedy itself, and announces her intention to quit the circuit. To use self-deprecating humour when you are already deemed worthless, she suggests, is further humiliation. In the final third, she deconstructs misogyny, including her own internalised misogyny. She had never told the full story of the bus-stop incident, for example – that the man had come back and beaten her up, that nobody had stopped him, and that she didn’t go either to the police or the hospital afterwards, because she didn’t think she was worth it. Gadsby desperately needed to hear stories like hers when she was younger, but instead had been complicit in silencing them. No more.",
      "Gadsby grew up in small-town, bible-belt Tasmania. Homosexuality was a crime there until 1997, so – she says jovially in her set – the likes of her were supposed to “pack up your Aids in a suitcase and fuck off to Mardi Gras”. But the island state is also the butt of incest jokes from mainland Australia, so she felt instinctively protective of it. It is not the only time she has found that loyalty can be at the expense of the self; at the end of Nanette she reveals painfully, briefly, that she was sexually abused as a child and raped as a young woman, but doesn’t go into details. How that silence – within a show about breaking silence – must sting.",
      "“It’s this murky area where you know the people and it has repercussions for their families,” she says, “so I don’t know how to put that out there in the world in a constructive and safe way for both me and all involved. We only have an existing narrative framework for a stranger doing violence to you.”"

      "Persists in the collective psyche, but we now know that sexual offences against children are the crimes least likely to involve strangers. Most children will be abused by opportunists in adult relationships: the married relatives, the family friends, the pillars of the community, the good blokes. “A lot of people who have experienced trauma at the hands of people they’ve trusted take responsibility, and that is what’s toxic,” Gadsby says. “It’s bullshit that as a kid I’d care for a person that was abusing me, but you just do and that’s the horrific thing.”",
      "Shame and rage are the twin forces behind Nanette, but rage, at least, has velocity. It is purposeful, powering her to the final third, whereas shame welds the feet to the ground. Gadsby considers this delineation. “Shame has its place,” she says. “Shame is what you do to a kid to stop them running on the road. And then you take the shame away and immediately they’re back in the fold. You should never soak anybody in shame. It’s the prolonged existence of shame that then flips out into destructive rage. We can’t exist in that. It’s like treacle.”"

      "Recently, Adam closed a seed round of $2 million with a private equity firm based in London, Brazil and Colombia. His entire pitch consisted of one simple, 40-minute, five-slide presentation. One brave man in jeans and a T-shirt, five basic slides, 18 jokes, but no product. His first slide was simply a quote taken straight out of Seinfeld: “This is a show about nothing.”",
      "But how did he do it? Adam explains it was all about philosophy, experience, age and passion. In fact, he even hired a professional screenwriter for his self-described 40-minute stand-up comedy act to pitch to the private equity firm, which he practiced for a week. Then he gave them the best show possible. For Adam, entertainment is everything: standup = startup.",
      "A few days later, they signed a $2 million round with no product, just a smart and rather simple, yet very real belief: “Look,” Adam explains, “nobody knows what the next big thing is going to be, it’s all just speculation. My goal is to build a team of five to six people, all veterans with a proven track record, all over the age of 35, to create that next big thing, whatever it may be.”",
      "“When you ask the common entrepreneur who is his role model is,” Adam continues, “ I bet most of them will say Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. Mine is Bob Parsons, the founder of GoDaddy. He turned a boring domain registry into one of the sexiest services online today. Hell, buying a 30-second commercial with 90% of what's left in your company’s bank account is what I call an ‘all in’ move. Sometimes, that’s the only way to make a dramatic change -- for better or for worse. Status-quo is a b****.”",
      "Experience Over Youth",
      "Although his thinking is logical, Adam’s ideas are bucking the trend -- especially in startups that tend to hire mostly young people.",
      "“Most startups hire 20-year-old kids who are willing to work day and night at the office,” Adam says. “I don’t believe in that. I’d much rather hire an older, more experienced employee to work a regular eight-hour workday and who will get more done in that time than an inexperienced 20-year-old kid would in week!”",
      "He cites the example of single mothers, explaining how they come to work at 8 a.m. sharp, make their cup of coffee, sit at their work stations and don't get up till 3 p.m. when they have to leave to go pick up their kids. In those seven hours, they manage to get more work done than most other employees simply because they need to be more efficient with their time. Those are the types of workers Adam is looking for.",
      "Team First, Then Product",
      'After a career of marketing more than 1,000 different products, Adam decided that he would not build a single web page unless he was backed with the right money to build the right team to research, test, and find the "golden angle." Now that his venture has been generously funded, Adam has assembled the best team he can find: a handpicked team of hard-working, experienced and passionate people who want to build things. For Adam, at the end of the day, it\'s all about the team. As for what that team will create, well, that remains to be decided.',
      "Adam did share one very key insight he picked up along the way: Stop looking for funding where everyone else is looking. Seek your money where the VCs seek theirs.",
      '“Everybody looks for funding in the same old places, with the same old VCs,” Adam shakes his head. “Open your mind and look elsewhere. Be unique. If you’re building a product that’s unique, the place where you seek funding should be unique, too. Ask yourself where those VCs get their money and go there."'

After all, I was lucky enough to be working at a venue outside the journalistic list mines. I’ve written my share of lists, and they make me itch—so reductive, so mathematical.

      "On the other hand, it’s hard to deny that some shows are better than others—and I’m hardly immune to arguing. So this year I thought I’d begin my annual refusal to make a list with some comparisons. Among other things, statistically speaking, Amazon’s “Transparent” is 27.5 times better than FX’s “Fargo.” (I measured.) Yes, they are very different. “Fargo,” which has topped several best-TV lists, is a stylized drama that strips the Coen brothers’ movies for parts. The series includes some truly beautiful scenes, including a dazzling shootout in the snow. But it is the same old, same old: just another of cable drama’s nicely tailored empty suits. In contrast, “Transparent,” Jill Soloway’s new series about a bunch of L.A. Jews, feels new. It swings. It’s funny, sad, loose, dirty, humane without being corny—it opens doors. It changes the viewer. “Fargo” ’s stylish looks are certainly seductive, but they’re a charade: the show is less auteurist than auteurist-ish. “Transparent” shakes up the system.",
      "NBC’s “Hannibal” is another show like that: a gorgeous, radical, unsettling horror series, a joint vision of empathy and cruelty. It is fifteen times better than HBO’s “True Detective,” for all of the latter’s manly charms. “Jane the Virgin” is thirty times better than ninety per cent of all network shows. Fiona Apple’s theme song to “The Affair” is way better than “The Affair.” Watch “Outlander,” not “Downton Abbey”!",
      "O.K., I’ll drop the fake math and rude comparisons. The truth is, this is an oddly difficult year to boil down. Everything is in flux, in the best way: the TV seasons have dissolved, and so has the distinction between comedy and drama. Directors have begun to flood a medium that used to be run by writers. New variations on television keep pouring through odd outlets, from Netflix and Amazon and probably, soon, your coffee maker. Online TV is blossoming for real."

The daughter of a self-made lawyer and businessman, Kardashian is certainly a hard worker: her ubiquitous image is the result of countless red carpet appearances and strategic selfies."

      "Detractors of fashion often complain about the convention of the non-smiling model and the industry’s love of a surly pout has even been lambasted in films such as Zoolander. Catwalks have long been a smile-free zone – well, you can smile at the end when the designer pops up to present you with a bunch of flowers, but during the show, the smile is a no-no. In fashion editorials, too, smiles are like steak and chips on a model’s plate: very rare.",
      "The other thing that has always troubled me about this is how tiresomely predictable it is. Being predictable is great if you are a bus or an excellent cup of coffee – but surely the essence of fashion is to push aesthetic boundaries, to welcome change for change’s sake. So why do they pull the same miserable faces at every single show, every single season, every single year. Stupid, isn’t it?",
      "Haughty couture .Or maybe it isn’t. The still expression of the fashion model is actually saying a lot of things. There’s an interesting heritage to it, too. It comes from the look of aristocratic disdain we see in centuries of royal portraiture which informed the 19th-century cartes de visite – society calling cards complete with what we might now term a “profile picture”.",
      "Fashion photography – think Horst P.Horst in the early to mid-20th century – has also long used the haughty look to suggest the status that the right clothes could bring to the wearer in a more socially mobile society. Essentially, this look says: “I am better than you”, because it refuses to offer the open, smiling face of welcome that we conventionally use to engage someone we wish to interact with. It also conveys the self-control, stiff upper lip and nonchalance of the European upper classes – “civilised” qualities which the “jolly old working classes” in those days supposedly found hard to convey.",
      "To be emotionally controlled also suggests elevation above earthly concerns, access to higher knowledge and – in the modern world – an ability to be “unshakeable”. This is even more impressive in what theorist  Erving Goffman called “fateful situations” – situations in which you or your dignity and composure are at greater than average risk."

    typeArticle: ["featured news", "trend"],
    shortDescription:
      "France has joined Italy and Israel in passing laws banning the promotion of extreme thinness in the fashion industry. The health reforms, which include fining agencies employing models with a BMI under 18 and criminalising pro-anorexia web content, have now passed through the upper house of parliament.",
    slider: "",

      "Perhaps, as the authors suggested, these images activated, rather than cultivated, beauty ideals.",
      "It has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness."
    ],
    longDescription: [
      "An analysis of the reforms by Sarah Jackson on The Conversation suggested that censoring images of ultra-thin models may ease their adverse effects on young women, such as concerns about body image and behaviours such as unhealthy eating.",
      "But while some have been hailing the legislation as a “crackdown on anorexia”, the laws may be unlikely to have any such effect.",
      "Not a lifestyle choice",
      "In western Europe, around 0.5% of adults are thought to be affected by anorexia nervosa. In around 10% of these cases, the sufferers are men. These figures, however, are likely to be an underestimation. It has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness, mostly due to organ failure and suicide.",
      "Yet, the illness is often mistaken by many as a lifestyle choice with an external cause. Despite accounts of the disorder pre-dating the fashion industry, the view that anorexia is caused by comparing oneself to a catwalk model remains popular. Likewise, while pro-ana websites insist that anorexia is a commitment, not an illness, they are highly exclusive online communities, created by and for those already showing signs of the illness. The merely curious are not welcome.",
      "Instead, the link between media endorsement of extreme thinness and the development of anorexia is neither simple nor clear. Research mentioned by Jackson did find that women evaluated their bodies more negatively after viewing images of thin models. However, this effect was small and mostly determined by women’s pre-existing opinions of their figures – women who were already dissatisfied with their body were most affected.",
      "Pre-existing opinions matter.  Joana Coccarelli, CC BY",
      "As this effect was only measured at one point in time, the effects of prolonged exposure are not known, but when more images were used there was a tendency for the effect to be smaller. Perhaps, as the authors suggested, these images activated, rather than cultivated, beauty ideals.",
      "Whether the effects of media exposure on body dissatisfaction leads to changes in eating behaviour is also unclear. Another study, also cited by Jackson, looked for a link between a person’s real-life media exposure and eating disorder symptoms. The results were fairly inconsistent, with some factors – such as body dissatisfaction – only corresponding to some types of media, and others – such as self-worth – showing no relationship.",
      "More importantly, the research showed correlation, not causation – it is just as plausible that women already unhappy with their bodies seek out thinness-promoting media more often. After all, if such a simple causal relationship did exist, the pervasiveness of these images in our culture raises the question of why the majority of our population is overweight, rather than underweight.",
      "Model bans but no support",
      "Most researchers currently view the cultural value placed on thinness as a “background risk factor”. Meanwhile, several psychological and biological factors are implicated.",
      "High levels of perfectionism, a need for organisation and a focus on details are often observed in those with anorexia. Recent research suggests there is a lower reward response to food in the brain, even after recovery. Some of these factors seem to be influenced by genetic inheritance. Stressful experiences may then influence whether these existing factors then lead to developing the disorder. More than one risk factor will be necessary.",
      "So the legislation is likely to have little effect on the prevalence of anorexia in the general population, but it also offers no support to the models themselves. The law requires a medical certificate proving that a model has a BMI of at least 18. This is still underweight, according to the World Health Organisation. Regular weigh-ins have been only vaguely suggested and there’s been no mention of an obligation to offer support to a model who fails a weigh-in."

Thinness of this degree has hugely damaging effects on the internal organs, bones and brain. It can cause obsessiveness and social withdrawal even in psychologically healthy people. France has already lost a high-profile model to anorexia – yet the new laws almost encourage agencies to wash their hands of models who fall ill.",
      "In the same way, while pro-ana content is undoubtedly harmful, the new laws punish those who are in need of help. This exclusively punitive approach is likely to drive these sites further undergound.",
      "If the measures are enforced – if spot checks continue, weigh-ins aren’t cheated and other countries are supportive – they may be a positive move. They may be a first step towards a culture that prioritises health over aesthetics – whether that means a dangerously small or unhealthily large body. Nonetheless, this will mostly benefit the worried well – those who, regrettably, are unhappy with their bodies, but are otherwise unlikely to develop anorexia nervosa. Claiming that these laws address one of the most treatment-resistant mental illnesses is far too optimistic."

The Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, developed twenty years ago measures infants' responses to pictures of novel objects. An infant pairs two pictures together for a set period of time, observed by a researcher. One of these pictures is then paired with a new image. The researcher again records the time the infant focuses on the new and old images. Normally, infants spend about 60% of the time looking at the new images.",

      'The researchers were able to show an association with intelligence between an early ability to process information and IQ during young adult years. Infants who were able to process novel information at an early age also showed higher levels of academic achievement later in life.

      "The researchers used an fMRI scanner, which monitors changes in blood flow within the brain to measure brain activity, to show how the brain reacts to unexpected changes in a sequence of images. Subjects are shown a series of four images which are then repeated, changing the order of the final two. The hippocampus appeared to react when a different image appeared."

      "Anke Plagnol and Richard Easterlin's study is said to be the first to use nationally representative long-term data to examine the role of lack of fulfilment in a person's sense of well-being. Researchers explain that expectations of success may vary between generations and demographic characteristics alter over time. Controlling for relevant factors such as race and education, they found that women are, on average, happier than men in early adulthood but after the age of 48 the position is reversed especially in relation to family and finances.",
      "Anke Plagnol said:",
      '"Men come closer to fulfilling their aspirations, are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations, and are the happier of the two."',

      '"Differences between men and women in aspirations for marriage and children are fairly small. Gender differences in satisfaction depend largely on attainment."',
      "Researchers found that the least happy period of the average man's life was his twenties when he was most likely to be single. Young men are also more dissatisfied with their financial situations, not because they are worse off, but because they want more. Those in a relationship also tend to be in a stronger financial position than those who must depend solely on their own resources.",
      'After the age of 34, men are more likely to be married than women, and the happiness gap widens with age, mirroring men\'s growing satisfaction with family life. Men also become more satisfied with their financial situations over time, as reflected in their increased spending power. Researchers found that men tend to covet expensive items that might not be affordable until later in life, such as a car or vacation home. However, women want more "nice clothes" than men. These findings are consistent with an earlier study by Richard Easterlin showing that recent generations are less satisfied than previous generations, despite having more.',
      "Anke Plagnol said:",
      "\"Of course, one doesn't have to be married to be happy, but if that's something you really want - and it is for most people - then the failure to attain it can have an impact on your overall happiness.\"",

      "48: Age at which men's overall happiness exceeds women's overall happiness",
      "64: Age at which men's satisfaction with family life exceeds women's satisfaction",

Researchers from the University of Virginia, the University of Illinois and Michigan State University analyzed data from the World Values Survey of economic, social, political and religious influences and studied the behaviors and attitudes of 193 Illinois undergraduate students.",
      "Researchers explain that many indicators of success and well-being (such as relationships, employment, health and longevity) are correlated with greater happiness with some studies suggesting that it is causal rather than consequent. However, their findings challenge the common assumption that all positive measures increase along with happiness. Individuals classifying themselves as most happy (10 on a 10-point life satisfaction scale) were in some respects worse off than those scoring slightly less.",

      '"But there is a caveat, and that is to say: \'Do you then have to be happier and happier? How happy is happy enough?"',

Profoundly happy people may be less inclined to alter their behavior or adjust to external changes even when flexibility would be advantageous. Data from the World Values Survey supported that prediction.",

However the most satisfied individuals were more successful socially, engaging more often as volunteers and maintaining more stable relationships.",
      "The study of 193 undergraduates revealed a similar pattern. Students were categorized as unhappy, slightly happy, moderately happy, happy or very happy. Success in categories related to academic performance (such as grade-point average, class attendance and conscientiousness) increased as happiness increased, but decreased slightly for individuals classified as very happy. However, the very happy group scored significantly higher on social factors (such as gregariousness, close friendships, self-confidence, energy and time spent dating).",
      "Researchers suggest that happiness may need to be moderated for success in some areas of life, such as income, conscientiousness and career."

The explanation is that strong emotions synchronize the brain activity of different individuals according to research by Finland's Aalto University and Turku PET Centre research published in the Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences",
      "Seeing emotional expressions such as smiles and laughter in someone else often triggers a corresponding emotional response in the watcher. This may be a basic element of social interation: synchronyzing a common emotional state in all members of a group whose brains process what they see of the environment around themin a similar fashion.",
      "The Finnish researchers measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants were looking at short pleasant, neutral and unpleasant movies.The researchers found that strong and unpleasant emotions synchronized participants brains’ emotion processing networks in the frontal and midline regions while highly arousing movies synchronized activity in brain networks supporting vision, attention and sense of touch.",
      "According to Adjunct Professor Lauri Nummenmaa from Aalto University:",
      '"Sharing others’ emotional states provides the observers a somatosensory and neural framework that facilitates understanding others’ intentions and actions and allows to ‘tune in’ or ‘sync’ with them. Such automatic tuning facilitates social interaction and group processes.',
      '"The results have major implications for current neural models of human emotions and group behaviour, but also deepen our understanding of mental disorders involving abnormal socioemotional processing.',
      "Contagious Laughter",
      "The new study can be compared with with one by researchers at University College (UCL) and Imperial College London published in the Journal of Neuroscience in 2007 showed a possible mechanism for contagious laughter. Positive sounds like laughter trigger a response in the area of the listener's brain activated when we smile, as though preparing facial muscles to laugh."

      "\"Cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew's description of Ian Botham's freak dismissal, falling over his own stumps 'he couldn't quite get his leg over' was all it took to send himself and the late Brian Johnston into paroxysms of laughter.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Scott, senior research fellow at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience said:",
      "\"It seems that it's absolutely true that 'laugh and the whole world laughs with you'. We've known for some time now that when we are talking to someone, we often mirror their behaviour, copying the words they use and mimicking their gestures. Now we've shown that the same appears to apply to laughter, too - at least at the level of the brain.\"",
      "Researchers played volunteers various sounds while measuring brain responses using an fMRI scanner. Some sounds were positive, for example laughter or triumph. Others were unpleasant, such as screaming or retching. All triggered a response in the premotor cortical region of the brain, which prepares facial muscles to respond accordingly. However, the response was greater for positive sounds, suggesting that these were more contagious than negative examples. The researchers believe this explains why we respond to laughter or cheering with an involuntary smile.",
      "Sophie Scott commented:",
      '"We usually encounter positive emotions, such as laughter or cheering, in group situations, whether watching a comedy programme with family or a football game with friends. This response in the brain, automatically priming us to smile or laugh, provides a way of mirroring the behaviour of others, something which helps us interact socially. It could play an important role in building strong bonds between individuals in a group."'
